# Raindance
These are a series of MATLAB functions written by Byron A. Adams. Each function contains a header with basic functionality info along with expected inputs and possible outputs.

# Release
v.1 is the first and current release. The release includes all files in the 'master' repository along with a .mat file including the example data set used in the first publication to use raindance (see attribution below). New releases will be created when major changes in the codes are completed.

# Branches
There are two branches on this repository, 'master' and 'Development'. Functions in the 'master' branch are stable (to the best of my knowledge). Functions in the 'Development' branch (including versions of functions in 'master' that have been modified) are still in the testing phase.
