# Raindance
These are a series of MATLAB functions written by Byron A. Adams. Each function contains a header with basic functionality info along with expected inputs and possible outputs.

# Release
v.1 is the first and current release. The release includes all files in the 'master' repository along with a .mat file including the example data set used in the first publication to use raindance (see attribution below). New releases will be created when major changes in the codes are completed.

# Branches
There are two branches on this repository, 'master' and 'Development'. Functions in the 'master' branch are stable (to the best of my knowledge). Functions in the 'Development' branch (including versions of functions in 'master' that have been modified) are still in the testing phase.

# Attribution
If you use or modify these codes and use the results in a publication, please cite the corresponding publication: B.A. Adams, K.X. Whipple, A.M. Forte, A.M. Heimsath, and K.V. Hodges. Isolating cliamte controls on erosion and topgraphy (in review).

# Error Reporting and Feature Request
If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature / improvement the preferred method of communication is to use the 'Issues' function built into GitHub. You can also email Byron [byron.adams 'at' bristol.ac.uk]. If you encounter an issue that you know how to fix and are comfortable with how git works, please feel free to fork the code and submit a pull request with fixes and improvements.
